  Growing up in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a supportive family and a community that fostered curiosity and creativity. Among the many people who shaped my early years, my mom stands out as the most significant influence. Her strength, wisdom, and constant encouragement have been a guiding force in my life, motivating me to pursue my passions and embrace challenges head-on.

  From a young age, I developed a love for activities that engage both my mind and body. Cooking, playing games, and spending time outdoors are some of my favorite pastimes. I find joy in the process of creating something from scratch, whether it’s a new recipe in the kitchen or solving problems through engineering concepts. The thrill of figuring out how things work, whether it’s a gadget or a new game, has been a consistent source of inspiration for me. These activities not only bring me happiness but also help me build the skills that will guide me in my future career as an engineer.

  One of the things that excites me most about engineering is the opportunity to solve real-world problems and make a tangible impact. My love for this field has been reinforced through various accomplishments, including completing the 2023 and 2024 Gauss Math Contests, where I challenged myself with complex problems and expanded my problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I have earned multiple medals in kung fu tournaments, a testament to my dedication, discipline, and perseverance. Both of these achievements have taught me the value of hard work and determination, principles that I carry with me in all aspects of my life.

  While I find fulfillment in academics and competitions, I also cherish the moments spent with my family. Whether it's playing games, sharing stories, or simply enjoying each other’s company, my family plays a vital role in grounding me. These connections remind me of the importance of balance—working hard while also making time for the people who matter most.

  My values of honesty, optimism, and respect guide my decisions and interactions with others. I believe that being truthful, maintaining a positive outlook, and treating everyone with kindness and fairness are essential to creating meaningful relationships and achieving personal success. These values have shaped the way I approach my goals and challenges, and I aim to carry them with me into my future career and beyond.

  As I continue my journey, I’m excited about the possibilities ahead. In the next 5 to 10 years, I envision myself as a successful engineer, working on innovative projects that make a difference in the world. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to a field that challenges and excites me. Whether it’s developing new technologies or improving existing systems, I’m determined to leave a lasting impact.

  At home, I have a pet cat, whose playful antics remind me to take life one step at a time and not to take things too seriously. She adds an extra layer of joy to my everyday life and serves as a reminder to stay grounded as I chase my dreams.

  Ultimately, my story is one of growth, perseverance, and passion. From the early influence of my mom to my current pursuits in engineering, I’ve learned that the journey is just as important as the destination. By staying true to my values, staying curious, and maintaining a positive attitude, I know I’m on the path to a bright and fulfilling future.
